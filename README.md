# AI Searching Algorithms
A collection of both uninformed and informed search algorithms.
1. Breadth First Search (uninformed)
2. Depth first Search (Uninformed)
3. A-Star Search (Informed)
4. Iterative Deepening A-Star Search (Informed)

Heuristic:
My heuristic for both A\* and IDA\* was a summation a summation of the Manhattan distances of the gameboard's ith tile to the ith index.
